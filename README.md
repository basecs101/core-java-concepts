# Core-Java-Concepts-And-Programs
## Exploring almost everything in core java
1. Java Introduction 
    - what, why and how @ Java Programming
2. Java Architecture
   - Java development Kit `JDK`
   - Java Runtime Environment `JRE`
   - Java Virtual Machine `JVM`
   - What is Java Source code(.java file) and ByteCode(.class file)
   - ClassLoader, Linker and JIT compiler
3. [What is classpath and how to set it.](https://medium.com/@basecs101/do-you-know-classpath-in-java-latest-2800574878c)
4. Number System
   - Binary, Decimal, Octal and Hexadecimal
   - Conversion from binary to decimal and vice-versa
5. Memory Types
   - Primary memory/Main Memory/ Random Access Memory
   - Secondary memory/Disk/ Read Only Memory
   - Cache and cache layering
   - Stack, Heaps and Method Areas
6. [Installation of JDK and Running HelloWorld.java program, and IntelliJ Idea Basics.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)
7. DataTypes
   - Primitive(8 primitive types and their wrapper classes) 
   - and Non-Primitive(classes and arrays)
8. Conditional Statement - 
   - if , if-else and multiple if and if-else
   - nested if and if-else
9. Control Statement - Switch case and its examples
   - Loops
     - for and foreach
     - while 
     - and do-while
10. Java Comments and Java Documentations
    - Single line comment
    >          // hello single line comment
    - Multiline comment
    >         /*
    >         Hello from
    >         multi line comment
    >         */
    - Java Doc
    >        /**
    >         * This class {@code Shape} is an abstract class to demonstrate partial abstraction
    >         * and features of abstract class.

11. Classes and Objects
12. Java Packages
13. Access Modifiers/ Access Level/ Access Specifier
    1. Private
    2. Default
    3. Protected
    4. Public
14. Primitive Data and their Type Casting 
    > int to float and int to byte and other primitives
15. Constructor
    1. Rules
    2. Types
    3. Overloading
    4. Chaining
16. `this` and `super` keywords and their usages And `this()` and `super()` calls
17. OOP paradigm
    1. Inheritance
        - Definition
        - Rule
        - Types
        - [Upcasting and down-casting](https://medium.com/@basecs101/what-is-up-casting-and-down-casting-in-java-latest-ca114ef76a5f)
    2. Composition
       - what is composition and how to implement it
       - How composition and inheritance are different
    3. [Encapsulation](https://medium.com/@basecs101/are-you-confused-with-encapsulation-clear-it-now-updated-30bd6ca66bfa)
        - what is encapsulation and why do we need it
        - POJO and Beans and their differences
    4. Polymorphism
        - Overloading/static polymorphism/ compile time polymorphism
        - Overriding/ dynamic polymorphism/ runtime polymorphism
    5. Abstraction
        - Interfaces --> full abstraction
        - Abstract class --> partial abstraction
        - Diamond problem and solution
18. [Immutable class and String, String Pool, Wrapper classes.](https://medium.com/javarevisited/do-you-know-immutable-class-in-java-why-string-is-immutable-dc18b0cec4b9)
    1. Make all fields private
    2. Create all argument constructor
    3. Remove All setters
    4. Use deep clone for objects in the constructor and getter methods
    5. Make class as final
    6. Optional rule - make all fields as final
