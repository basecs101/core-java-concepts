/**
 * This interface defines features for different Shape Objects like
 * Circle, Rectangle, Square and Triangle etc.
 * By using this interface the developer wants to hide the implementations
 * of the methods of this interface.
 * By doing so, full abstraction(method implementation hiding) is achieved.
 * This interface can be shared by the developer to other 3rd party developers
 * to write their own shape objects and those shape objects will have their
 * own implementations of these abstract methods.
